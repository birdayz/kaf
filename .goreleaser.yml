    # GOARM to specify which 32-bit arm version to use if there are multiple versions

    # NOTE: make sure the url_template, the token and given repo (github or gitlab) owner and name are from the
    # same kind. We will probably unify this in the next major version like it is done with scoop.

    # GitHub/GitLab repository to push the formula to
    tap:
      owner: birdayz
      name: homebrew-kaf

      # Optionally a branch can be provided.
      # Defaults to the default repository branch.

      #token: "{{ .Env.HOMEBREW_TAP_GITHUB_TOKEN }}"

    # Template for the url which is determined by the given Token (github, gitlab or gitea)

    # Allows you to set a custom download strategy. Note that you'll need
    # to implement the strategy and add it to your tap repository.

    # Default is empty.
    # download_strategy: CurlDownloadStrategy

    # Allows you to add a custom require_relative at the top of the formula template

    # formula - instead, the formula file will be stored on the dist folder only,
    # leaving the responsibility of publishing it to the user.
    # If set to auto, the release will not be uploaded to the homebrew tap
    # in case there is an indicator for prerelease in the tag e.g. v1.0.0-rc1
